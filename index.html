									<h2>Short Bio of Kamryn J</h2>
									<p>I'm Kamryn Jackson, born August 8, 2007 class of 2025. I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing games and watching movies just like every other kid. But under the surface I am a follower of Jesus Christ and try to model my life after him. I am a hard worker and love to go on runs, it's somewhat calming. Family always comes first in my life even over myself sometimes, I like to help whenever I can no matter who it is. And even though I've been told I look scary once you get to know me I promise I'm a loveable guy. This is who I am..this is Kamryn.</p>
